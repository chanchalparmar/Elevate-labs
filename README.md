# Elevate Labs Internship Task1 – Data Cleaning

This repository contains the work completed as part of my internship task for Elevate Labs. The main objective of this task was to perform **data cleaning** on real-world datasets using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

##  Files Included

- `Data Cleaning-1.ipynb` – Data cleaning process on `Sales.csv` dataset.
- `Data Cleaning-2.ipynb` – Data cleaning process on `mpg-data.csv` dataset.
- `Sales.csv` – Raw dataset used in Task 1.
- `mpg-data.csv` – Raw dataset used in Task 2.
- (Optional: Add screenshots if applicable.)

##  What I Did

- Identified and handled missing values.
- Removed duplicate records.
- Corrected data types and fixed formatting issues.
- Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Saved cleaned datasets for further use.

The code is written in Python using libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** where applicable.
